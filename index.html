	<h1>Tony Bennett - The Hands of Time</h1>
	<p>	If the hands of time
		Were hands that I could hold
		I’d keep them warm and in my hands
		They’d not turn cold
	</p>
	<p>
		Hand in hand we’d choose
		The moments that should last
		The lovely moments that
		Should have no future
		And no past
	</p>
	<p>
		he summer from the top of a swing
		The comfort in the sound of a lullaby
		The innocence of leaves in the spring
		But most of all, the moment when love
		First touched me
	</p>
